# Cross-Component Operating System (CroCOS)

## Goals
* This project aspires to implement a reasonably small microkernel, with services like hardware drivers and filesystems all being implemented in userspace. 
* **Well commented**, well organized codebase
* Support for multiple architectures (amd64 and aarch64) and SMP implemented early. The initial focus will be on amd64, since this is the architecture I know best.
