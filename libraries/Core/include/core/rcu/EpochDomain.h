// Created by Spencer Martin on 8/1/26.
//
// Core::rcu::EpochDomain — the CroCOS epoch-based reclamation engine.
//
// Phase 1 of the RCU design (specs/rcu.md + specs/rcu-phase-1.md). This header
// is the WHOLE algorithm: the global epoch, the per-slot activation word, the
// activation/scan fence pairing, and the four-state limbo-bag machine that
// makes bags stealable. It has ZERO kernel dependencies (RCU-DEC-002) — the
// include set is capped at what TreiberStack.h allows itself — so it can be
// unit-tested as a pure algorithm with plain std::thread under TSan (R7).
//
// What the engine deliberately does NOT do (all Phase 2's job):
//   - own storage: it is constructed over a caller-supplied ReaderSlot array
//   - decide slot identity: the caller passes a slot index
//   - enforce forbidden-context rules: those need InterruptContextDepths
//   - know about SafePtr / TLB freshness: injected via the Hooks policy
//   - detect stalls: that needs a clock
//
// ─── The safety argument in one paragraph (RCU-DEC-004, as rewritten) ───────
//
// Three SEQ_CST fences carry the whole thing: the reader's activation fence
// (kReaderActivationFence), the scan's fence (kScanFence), and kRetireFence.
// Governing rule is C++20 [atomics.order]/4 bullet 4. Writing U for the
// caller's unlink, F_W for kRetireFence, L_W for retire's epoch load returning
// r, Sc2 for the scan whose CAS writes r+2 (epoch load L_S2 then fence F_Sc2),
// and R for a reader with epoch load L_R = s, activation store A_R, fence F_R,
// protected load D_R:
//   Lemma A: if D_R misses U then F_R <s F_W.
//   Lemma B: F_W <s F_Sc2   (L_W --fr--> CAS(r+1) --rf--> L_S2; needs I10).
//   Lemma C: if D_R misses U then s <= r.
//   Theorem: A+B give F_R <s F_Sc2, so Sc2 observes A_R or a co-later value.
//            If A_R, then s <= r != r+1 and I3 blocks Sc2 — contradiction.
//            If co-later, R already exited and the RELEASE/ACQUIRE pairing puts
//            its whole section happens-before the drain.
// The argument is C++20-specific and never requires the writer to be pinned.
//
// ─── Three lines that look removable and are not ───────────────────────────
//
//  1. kRetireFence. It guards a load that is "only" ACQUIRE, so it reads as
//     redundant. It is the entire fix for ITEM-007. Do not elide, move, or make
//     it conditional (in particular: do NOT skip it when the freshly-read epoch
//     already equals the open bag's tag — see ITEM-015).
//  2. I10 — tryAdvance's epoch load is sequenced BEFORE kScanFence. Reversing
//     the two collapses Lemma B while changing no ordering constant, and x86-TSO
//     would not fail. It is a correctness change disguised as a cleanup.
//  3. P1-DEC-004 — the scan never skips the calling CPU's own slot. A writer may
//     retire from inside its own section, so its own slot can legitimately be
//     active and must block its own advance.
//
// ─── Contract narrowing a future consumer will not expect ──────────────────
//
// RCU read-side sections are FORBIDDEN in NMI and #MC context (RCU-DEC-024).
// The original requirement promised legality "in any context up to and
// including NMI"; that promise is withdrawn, because the Phase-2 ReadGuard masks
// maskable interrupts across the outermost transition. Enforcement is a
// debug-only assert in the kernel veneer, so a profiler or watchdog author
// reaching for RCU from an NMI handler gets silence in a release build.
//
// ─── Caller obligations ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   - slot < slotCount, always.
//   - readLock/readUnlock balanced, on the same slot, and NOT reentered on the
//     same slot mid-transition. The engine is arch-free and cannot enforce this;
//     the Phase-2 ReadGuard supplies it with arch::InterruptDisabler, and the
//     userspace harness gets it for free by having no signal handlers.
//   - Every store that makes an object unreachable is sequenced before retire —
//     not merely "the unlink", since a splice has several.
//   - A writer installing a new node initializes it and publishes the link with
//     RELEASE. That is the other half of what makes the reader's ACQUIRE link
//     load meaningful.
//   - Deleters may run on ANY CPU, at any time after the grace period, and
//     since RCU-DEC-038 outside any read-side section. A deleter may read,
//     modify, or retire only state reachable SOLELY from the retired object; it
//     must not load a pointer out of the live structure (RCU-DEC-039). No
//     assert can catch a violation — cross-structure cleanup belongs at unlink
//     time, inside the writer's section.
//   - A protected pointer must not outlive its section. Nothing detects this.

    //     memory, whose pages are subject to reclaimSlabPage — the vmsmalloc
    //     DEC-047 stale-TLB bug class. The Phase-2 veneer supplies a hook calling
    //     VMSubstrate::ensureTLBEntryFresh. It fires once per node, before ANY
    //     ACCESS — read OR write — of that node's RetireHead fields, and covers
    //     ONLY those fields — not the object body and not anything the deleter
    //     reaches through. A Hooks policy that omits the freshness call is a
    //     Phase-2 bug.
    //
    //     BOTH SIDES CALL IT: drainClaimedBag before reading next/deleter, and
    //     retire before writing them. The write side was missing until the
    //     Phase 4 in-kernel stress found it on its first boot — the retiring CPU
    //     is routinely not the allocating one, so its stale mapping swallowed
