//
// RCU Phase 4 (spike) — in-kernel stress test.
//
// Replaces `VmsmallocStress` as the smp_bringup per-CPU stress routine. It
// exists to close parent-spec ITEM-021: after Phases 1-3 the framework has 1261
// green userspace tests and yet SEVERAL of its kernel-side mechanisms have never
// executed on a real target even once. Specifically:
//
//   1. the real arch::InterruptDisabler inside the RCU-DEC-024 masked window
//   2. KernelRcuHooks::onPreTouch -> VMSubstrate::ensureTLBEntryFresh
//   3. SafePtr dereference and its freshness cost
//   4. the real assert -> PANIC on every debug check
//   5. .icd ordering against a live AP
//
// (2) IS THE POINT. onPreTouch exists solely to guard the vmsmalloc DEC-047
// stale-TLB bug class, and DEC-047 was found by the IN-KERNEL VmsmallocStress —
// the userspace harness did not and structurally could not find it, because its
// ensureTLBEntryFresh is a no-op and userspace has no page tables. RCU's exposure
// is the same shape: under RCU-DEC-006 stealing, a drainer dereferences intrusive
// RetireHead links living in ANOTHER CPU's retired slab memory, whose pages are
// subject to reclaimSlabPage. So the one Phase-2 mechanism most likely to be
// wrong is precisely the one every existing test is blind to.
//
// A COROLLARY THAT SHAPES THE WORKLOAD: the bug class is only reachable if slab
// pages actually get reclaimed and re-backed while a retired node still sits in
// a limbo bag. A workload that never frees enough for reclaimSlabPage to fire
// leaves the hazard unexercised while looking perfectly healthy. Whether this
// workload achieves that is the open question of the spike, not an assumption of
// it — see the liveness counters.
//
// ─── Why it also carries vmsmalloc breadth ─────────────────────────────────
//
// VmsmallocStress swept all 8 slab size classes plus a DEC-029 whole-page bucket.
// Replacing it would silently drop that coverage, so the node types here span a
// small slab class, the largest slab class, and a whole-page allocation. RCU sees
// one uniform retire/drain protocol; vmsmalloc sees three allocation paths.
// Cross-domain frees come for free: under stealing, the CPU that runs a deleter
// is usually NOT the CPU that allocated the node, so vmsfree's cross-domain gate
// (DEC-019) is exercised without any explicit hand-off machinery.
//
// DEC-028 discipline: vmsmalloc is never used raw. Every allocation is
// VMSubstrate::make<T>, and every read of allocator-returned memory goes through
// SafePtr<T>, whose operator*/operator-> call ensureTLBEntryFresh first.
//
// The stress is its own success signal: it runs until the shutdown timer fires.
// A panic, a hang, or a corruption report is the failure.
