// RCU Phase 2 — the kernel veneer over Core::rcu::EpochDomain.
// Created by Spencer Martin on 8/1/26.
//
// Implements kernel/include/rcu/RCU.h. See specs/rcu-phase-2.md; the header
// carries the consumer-facing contract and this file carries the binding.
//
// Three things in here are worth reading before editing:
//
//   1. The engine type appears NOWHERE outside this TU (P2-DEC-009). Domain
//      holds opaque bytes; detail::Access launders them back into an
//      EpochDomain<KernelRcuHooks>. That is what keeps the Core template out of
//      every consumer TU and lets Domain's constructor stay constexpr-inert.
//
//   2. Slot storage geometry. EpochDomain indexes slots[i] at natural stride, so
//      the slot array must be DENSE and contiguous, while
//      reservePerDomainStaticBuffer places at PAGE granularity. Those two facts
//      together make "CPU i's slot on CPU i's NUMA domain" (P2-I4 as originally
//      written) unachievable; see the P2-I4 note on reserveSlots below for what
//      is achieved instead.
//
//   3. Every check is debug-only (RCU-DEC-013 / P2-DEC-005), gated on
//      CROCOS_RCU_DEBUG_CHECKS. In release the read side is one store plus one
//      fence, and the veneer is a call into the engine with no preamble.

    //
    // Under `-icount shift=0` QEMU derives the TSC from a virtual clock that

    // instructions retired. The constant of proportionality does not matter:
    // the headline number is a RATIO of two deltas measured in the same units.

    // Two modes, never both, because they would nest: mode 1 brackets the

    // reservePerDomainStaticBuffer places whole pages, so the finest NUMA
    // granularity available is one page — 32 slots at the current ReaderSlot
    // size. What is implemented instead is per-PAGE placement: each page is
    // reserved on the home domain of the first CPU whose slot lands on it. On
    // every configuration CroCOS actually boots (<= 32 CPUs) that is one page on
    // one domain, i.e. all slots local to CPU 0's domain; it starts paying off
    // on a machine large enough for slots to span pages, where CPU numbering is
    // conventionally socket-clustered. User-confirmed 2026-08-01.
    //
    // The alternatives were: a single whole-array reservation (identical below
    // 32 CPUs, no better above it), or one page per CPU plus a stride parameter
    // threaded through Phase 1's hot path (exact, but 4 KiB/CPU and it reopens a
    // shipped, TSan-green engine).
    //
    // ─── The domain-management lock and the block freelist (RCU-DEC-043) ───
    //
    // ONE lock for the whole framework, not one per Domain: it serializes every
    // init/deinit AND every consumer-side static-buffer reservation against the
    // same-entry install race (vmsmalloc DEC-051c), so it has to be the same
    // lock in both places.
    //
    // Blocks are recycled rather than reserved afresh. Reservations are
    // kernel-lifetime and are never returned to VMSubstrate, so without recycling
    // the reservation would grow with CUMULATIVE process churn until the
    // static-buffer window ran out and every later fork failed — which is
    // precisely the high-water-mark claim vmsmalloc DEC-050 makes.
    //
    // ─── Two paths, and why the branch is honest ───────────────────────────
    //
    // A slot array of `cpuCount <= kSlotsPerPage` slots is ONE page, and the two
    // things this code does with pages both go vacuous at one:
    //
    //   - **per-page NUMA placement** degrades to "pick a domain" (it picks CPU
    //     0's), because there is no second page to place differently;
    //   - **the contiguity dependency** below is a statement about consecutive
    //     reservations, and there is only one.
    //
    // So the single-page case can come from a shared, sub-page-granular
    // `PinnedBlockPool`, and it should: `sizeof(ReaderSlot)` is 128 B, so an
    // 8-CPU machine's slot array is 1,024 B and a dedicated page wastes 75% of
    // itself — on EVERY address space. Pooled, four of them share a page.
    //
    // That covers every machine up to 32 CPUs, which is the whole consumer-
    // desktop target. Above it the array genuinely spans pages, per-page
    // placement starts meaning something, and the old path — one whole-page
    // reservation per page, contiguity checked, whole blocks recycled through
    // `gFreeSlotBlocks` — is kept unchanged. Unifying the two would need a
    // contiguous-extent request from the pool, i.e. the pool growing the one
    // thing its header says it does not do.
    //
    // `gFreeSlotBlocks` linkage lives in the block's first word. Legal because a
    // freed block holds no live object: deinit has already poisoned it, and init
    // re-zeroes before constructing.
